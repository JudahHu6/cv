        <p><em>Front-End Developer.</em></p>
        <p>This the start of my career as a Developer. I am currently building my very first html site from scratch, and I am ecstatic about learning more.
          I have built sites in the past using wix and shopify, I also played around in wordpress. I have never built a site using code from scatch. I would say
          the most exciting part of all of this for me is understanding the concepts of coding. It much deeper than simply copying and pasting code.</p></td>
